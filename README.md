# BetterDiscord Plugins

## Repo by BlockBa5her

Just to clarify, none of the scripts in this repo are made by me. These scripts all go out to the original authors of the scripts and I love them for making them, I just wanted to make a quick collection of scripts for BetterDiscord that anyone could use and download.

All of the credits to the scripts and script owners are found in the `CREDITS.md` file.

## Installation

Drag all of the plugins from the `/plugins` folder to the directory of the BetterDiscord plugins

### Finding the directory

* Open the settings for discord, navigate to `Plugins` section, and click the button `Open Plugin Folder`

or

* Navigate to the directory `%AppData%/BetterDiscord/plugins`

### Enabling the plugins

You will have to enable every plugin one by one, sadly.

* Just go the the `Plugins` section in the settings, and click the check boxes next to the plugins
  * If there is no plugins to check, please hit `CTRL`+`R` to reload the discord cache
